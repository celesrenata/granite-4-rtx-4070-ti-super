# Phases

Each phase has exit criteria; a phase is done only when its criteria are met
on a real sm_89 machine. Until P3 exits, the API keeps answering
`unavailable` / 501.

## P0 — Scaffold (this commit) ✅

- API surface with validation and an explicit unavailable boundary (400/501).
- Model constants in both languages, cross-checked by tests.
- C ABI metadata/status placeholder; host-only C++ test.
- CMake builds the host side without a CUDA toolkit; CUDA path targets sm_89.
- Docs: architecture, phases, memory budget (planning figures only).

Exit criteria: `pytest` and `ctest` (host-only) pass on a machine without CUDA.

## P1 — Weights (host side complete)

- Safetensors loader; parse checkpoint `config.json` and reject on any
  deviation from the spec (hard fail, listed field-by-field).
- Decide storage: FP8 (weights) is the working default — see
  [memory.md](memory.md); BF16 does not fit the card.
- Export a quantization pass for activations where kernels need it.

Exit criteria: full checkpoint loaded and checksummed; `nvidia-smi` memory
matches the plan within 5%; config mismatch on a perturbed checkpoint fails
fast with the exact field list.

**Done (host, no CUDA):** `granite4-checkpoint verify <dir>` streams the
whole checkpoint with bounded memory and reports per-shard and per-tensor
SHA-256, exact tensor count / shapes / dtypes against the derived expected
set, and a strict config.json check (field-by-field deviations, non-fatal —
a wrong config is reported, it does not abort the checksum pass). The real
8B checkpoint verifies clean: 4 shards, 363 tensors, 17,583,185,920 bytes,
config_ok, zero issues. `granite4-checkpoint export <dir> <out.safetensors>
[--per-channel]` writes a self-describing FP8 e4m3 checkpoint (weights +
per-tensor or per-channel F32 scales) that parses back through the
safetensors manifest. Both are covered by `ctest` (5 suites) and cross-checked
against `python hashlib`. `head_dim` is derived (`hidden_size / heads`) in
both the C++ parser and `scripts/inspect_checkpoint.py`, matching the real
config.json which omits it. The remaining exit criterion — `nvidia-smi`
residency within 5% of the plan — is deferred to the first sm_89 run.

## P2 — Kernels (sm_89) ✅

- GEMM (FP8 e4m3 weights; Ada has no Blackwell-style block-scaled MMA, so
  scales are per-tensor/channel — decided here), attention with GQA
  (32 Q / 8 KV, head dim 128), RMSNorm, rotary, activations, sampling.
- Each kernel unit-tested against a CPU reference on the same seed.

Exit criteria: per-kernel correctness on randomized inputs; micro-benchmark
script with the bandwidth/roofline baseline measured (not assumed).

**Done (verified on gremlin-1, RTX 4070 Ti Super / sm_89, CUDA 13.3):** the
portable reference math (`engine/src/kernel_math.h`) and the device kernels
(`engine/src/kernels_phase2.cu`) for the full P2 set — **RMSNorm, RoPE
(half-split), scaled softmax (attention-multiplier logits), FP8-e4m3 × BF16
GEMM with per-tensor dequant, GQA attention (Q·Kᵀ + value accumulation, gh =
Hq/Hk), fused SwiGLU gate/up, and sampling (deterministic greedy + top-p)** —
each checked against the reference with seeded randomized inputs (1–4 ULP
tolerance; sampling is an exact discrete match), plus the sm_89 arch probe.
Greedy is additionally verified at the full 100352-vocab size. Host reference:
`kernel_math` ctest (runs everywhere). Device: `kernels_device` ctest
(`GRANITE_ENABLE_CUDA=ON`).

**Micro-benchmark / roofline baseline:** `granite4-kernel-bench`
(`engine/src/kernels_bench.cu`) measures the card's *actual* streaming read
and copy bandwidth with CUDA events and prints the roofline note (decode is
read-bound; tokens/s = read_gbps / fp8 weight bytes per token) as JSON. The
baseline is measured on the card, not assumed. Per the cross-phase rule, the
measured numbers are kept out of the repo until P4; they are reproducible
from the binary (below).

**Folded into the GPU host's flake:** `packages.x86_64-linux.engine-cuda`
compiles the whole sm_89 build — kernels, the device-test binary, and the
micro-benchmark — and `doCheck` runs every ctest suite *except* the GPU-only
`kernels_device` run (that needs the host driver's `libcuda` plus a live
device, which a build sandbox cannot reach). The GPU host re-verifies the
device kernels with one command:
```
granite4-kernel-test     # device correctness (== the kernels_device ctest)
granite4-kernel-bench    # measured bandwidth / roofline baseline (JSON)
```

## P3 — Integration

- Scheduler (N concurrent sequences), prefill/decode loop, paged KV, prefix
  cache; memory manager wired to the plan in [memory.md](memory.md).
- Golden parity: fixed prompts, seeded sampling, compared token-for-token
  against the reference implementation (transformers/other engine) with
  quantization noise bounded per spec.

Exit criteria: parity gate passes; the API flips to serving; `/health`
reports `inference: available` only after the gate.

**In progress:** the paged KV memory manager + prefix cache
(`engine/src/kv_pool.{h,cc}`) is done and host-verified (7/7 ctest on a
host-only build): a paged pool sized from the [memory.md](memory.md) budget,
token-major byte layout, page-aligned prefix sharing (ref-counted,
content-addressable with a token-verified collision guard), and LRU eviction
of retained (unreferenced, still-cached) pages. The GPU KV write/compaction
kernel, the prefill/decode loop, and the concurrent-sequence scheduler build
on top of this and are not yet implemented; no part of P3 runs end-to-end on
the GPU yet, and the API still reports `unavailable`.

## P4 — Performance

- Kernel and scheduling tuning at a fixed power limit.
- Benchmark harness: decode (code/JSON/prose), concurrent throughput, long
  context; identical conditions and scripts per comparison.

Exit criteria: benchmark table lands in `docs/` **with reproduction
commands**; only numbers measured in this phase may be stated anywhere.

## Rules across phases

- No kernel or code is copied from `reference/qwen3-27b-5090/`; it is kept
  for layout and conventions only.
- No benchmark number is written into this repo before P4, and none is
  claimed without its conditions + commands.
- Status stays honest: any endpoint that cannot do a thing says so with a
  machine-readable code, never a placeholder value.
